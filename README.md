This is a public repository created to improve my perfomance on learning german. 
> For copyright reasons I will not publish pdfs of books I'm using at classroom, 
but feel free to search for the books in the bibliographic references.

> Since I've already got german leasons, this repo will start from level A2. For reference, I learned the A1 level using the book _Schritte International_. Besides that, I'll also solve some A1 exercises from another book (Klipp und Klar).
