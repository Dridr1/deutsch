This is a public repository created to improve my perfomance on learning german. 
> For copyright reasons i will not publish pdfs of books i'm using at classroom, 
but feel free to search for the books in the bibliographic references.

> Since i've already got german leasons, this repo will start from level A2. For reference, i learned the A1 level using the book _Schritte International_. Besides that, i'll also solve some A1 exercises from another book (Klipp und Klar)
